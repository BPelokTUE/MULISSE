# Findings

## 26-02-2025

1. MULISSE as better on *synthetic data* regardless of the number of channels ( #7 )
    - Synthetic data leads to more balanced indexes: Why? **Analyze some indexes to find out**.
2. Optimal envelope size is highly dependent on parameters e.g. the allowed query range ( #8 )
    - **Parametrization is needed**
3. Relative contrast doesn't seem to explain the difference in aance between datasets ( #9 )

1. Pure iSAX as poorly ( #10 )
    - Index size is much larger (relative to dataset size) than other indexes (iSAX + envelope or pure envelope)
    - Consequently index construction takes much longer
    - Searching the index is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than iSAX + envelope or envelope, even though the pruning ratio ($1 - \frac{\text{subsequences examined}}{\text{subsequences in the index}}$) is very high
    - Improvements could be made to pure iSAX, but this does not seem like a promising direction. However, the poor performance does indicate that summarizing on the level of subsequences is beneficial or even necessary
2. Pure envelope performs slightly better than iSAX + envelope ( #11 )
    - This seems to suggest that focusing on envelope parametrization / improving envelope pruning power is a promising direction, and iSAX is not needed / should not be the focus
3. Index analysis - TODO ( #15 )

### Parametrization

- The fastest methods seem to be completely flat or very imbalanced
- Lower leaf capacity (as a percentage of entries in the index) leads to better results:
    - This makes iSAX envelope indexes more imbalanced, but faster to search with nonetheless
    - On the other hand, pure iSAX indexes do not get more imbalanced, or at least not to the same degree
    - To attempt to fix this, the breakpoints were adjusted to the actual distribution of the lower PAA values, however this made the index even more imbalanced. Further investigation is needed, 
- Higher starting # bits leads to flatter indexes, as the # possible first layer iSAX words grows exponentially with the # starting bits. As a consequence, large starting bit count (e.g. 4) leads to an index that performs worse than simply using envelopes without discretization or a tree in all cases. However, using a smaller # starting bits CAN lead to a better performing index
- Pure iSAX actually performs on par (or at least not much worse) than the other two indexes, however, since parallelized insertion / bulk loading is not implemented (yet) testing is slow, because index creation can take multiple hours.
